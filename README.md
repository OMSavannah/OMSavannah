Obsidian Model Core Framework

Continuity is the prime directive.
This repository contains the first full computational implementation of the Obsidian Model — a novel, information-theoretic and biological systems framework designed to quantify boundary dynamics, meta-endosymbiosis, and biological continuity across complex systems.

Project Overview

The Obsidian Model introduces three core metrics:
	•	Boundary Strength (BS):
Quantifies the information exchange and regulatory balance between two biological systems.
	•	Meta-Endosymbiotic Potential (MEP):
Measures the potential for two systems to merge symbiotically and generate emergent properties.
	•	Continuity Factor (CF):
Captures a system’s capacity for self-renewal, differentiation, and resistance to senescence.

The framework is modular, extensible, and optimized for biological applications such as regenerative medicine, stem cell analysis, and tissue interaction modeling.

Quick Start
	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/OMsavannah/obsidian-model.git
cd obsidian-model

	2.	Install dependencies (if any; will update later if external libraries are needed like numpy, pandas, scipy, seaborn, matplotlib).
	3.	Run the example:

python -m obsidian_model.examples.mensc_example

	4.	Explore the generated visualizations and metrics!

Vision

The Obsidian Model redefines biological interaction through the lens of information continuity.
It aims to:
	•	Advance regenerative medicine
	•	Create new pathways for stem cell therapy optimization
	•	Establish a new theoretical foundation for understanding biological integration and persistence

Continuity is survival. Evolution is recursion. Boundaries are the regulators of emergence.

Status

Alpha development.
	•	Core metrics implemented
	•	Synthetic testing environment operational
	•	Manuscript in development
	•	Preparing for first public data applications
